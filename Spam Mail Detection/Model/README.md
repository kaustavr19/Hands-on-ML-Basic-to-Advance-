PROJECT TITLE : Sms Spam Detection

GOAL : To predict whether the given message is spam or ham.

DATASET : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Sms Spam dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , I got the highest accuracy of 98 % using the Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost Classifier which is quite well for the given Brazil Fires dataset . I then did processing NLP using NLTK in which I have included Count Vectorizer for bag of words and TfiDf Vectorizer and I also included some steeming algorithms like Porter Stemmer in it . While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.
