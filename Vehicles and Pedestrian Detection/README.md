<h1>Real Time Detection of Vehicles and Pedestrians </h1>


In this project, we use Haar cascade files to train our classifier to detect different vehicles as well as pedestrians which makes it very robust. The proposed approach is computationally less expensive with faster processing speed. The project performs well on real life data thus making it practically useful.

This System has the following Haar Cascades:
1) Haar Cascade for Car detection
2) Haar Cascade for Bus Detection
3) Haar Cascade for Two-Wheeler Detection
4) Haar Cascade for Pedestrian Detection
